Edmonds [1965a] proved that also the maximum-weight matching problem can be
solved in polynomial time. Equivalently, the minimum-weight perfect matching problem can be solved in polynomial time. It is the problem:
(16) given: a graph G = (V, E) and a ‘weight’ function w : E → Q;
find: a perfect matching M minimizing P
e∈M w(e).
We describe the algorithm, assuming without loss of generality that G has at least
one perfect matching and that w(e) ≥ 0 for each edge e (we can add a constant to
all edge weights without changing the problem).
Like the cardinality matching algorithm, the weighted matching algorithm is based
on shrinking sets of vertices. Unlike the cardinality matching algorithm however, for
weighted matchings one has to ‘deshrink’ sets of vertices (the reverse operation of
shrinking). Thus we have to keep track of the shrinking history throughout the
iterations.
The algorithm is ‘primal-dual’. The ‘vehicle’ carrying us to a minimum-weight
perfect matching is a pair of a nested17 collection Ω of odd-size subsets of V , and a
function π : Ω → Q satisfying:
(17) (i) π(U) ≥ 0 if U ∈ Ω with |U| ≥ 3,
(ii) X
U∈Ω
e∈δ(U)
π(U) ≤ w(e) for each e ∈ E.
This implies that for each perfect matching N in G one has w(N) ≥
X
U∈Ω
π(U), since
(18) w(N) = X
e∈N
w(e) ≥
X
e∈N

π(U) = X

π(U)|N ∩ δ(U)| ≥ X

Notation and assumptions. Let be given Ω and π : Ω → Q. Define
17A collection Ω of subsets of a set V is called nested if U ∩ W = ∅ or U ⊆ W or W ⊆ U for any
U, W ∈ Ω.
86 Chapter 5. Nonbipartite matching
(19) wπ(e) := w(e) −

for any edge e ∈ E. (So (17)(ii) implies wπ(e) ≥ 0.)
G/Ω denotes the graph obtained from G by shrinking all sets in Ωmax, the set of
inclusionwise maximal sets in Ω. We will assume throughout that {v} ∈ Ω for each
v ∈ V . Hence, as Ω is nested and covers V , Ωmax is a partition of V .
When shrinking a set U ∈ Ω, we denote the new vertex representing the shrunk
set U just by U. So G/Ω has vertices the sets in Ωmax, with two distinct elements
U, U′ ∈ Ω
max adjacent if and only if G has an edge connecting U and U
′
. We denote
any edge of G/Ω by the original edge in G.
Throughout we restrict ourselves to Ω and π satisfying:
(20) for each U ∈ Ω with |U| ≥ 3, the graph obtained from G|U by shrinking all
inclusionwise maximal proper subsets of U that are in Ω, has a Hamiltonian
circuit CU of edges e with wπ(e) = 0.

M-alternating forests. An important role in the algorithm is played by a so-called
‘M-alternating forest’ relative to a matching M (cf. Figure 5.1).
Let M be a matching in a graph G = (V, E) and let W be the set of vertices
missed by M. Then a subset F of E is an M-alternating forest in G if F is a forest
containing M such that each component of (V, F) consists either of an edge in M
Section 5.3. Weighted matching algorithm 87
or contains exactly one vertex in W and such that each path in F starting in W is
M-alternating.
The set of vertices v ∈ V for which there exists an even-length (odd-length,
respectively) W − v path in F is denoted by even(F) (odd(F), respectively).
The algorithm. We iterate with Ω and π : Ω → Q satisfying (17) and (20), a
matching M in G/Ω and an M-alternating forest F in G/Ω with wπ(F) = 0.
Initially, we set M := ∅, F := ∅, Ω := {{v} | v ∈ V }, and π({v}) := 0 for
each v ∈ V . Then, as long as M is not a perfect matching in G/Ω, we perform the
following iteratively:
(21) Reset π(U) := π(U) − α for U ∈ odd(F) and π(U) := π(U) + α for U ∈
even(F), where α is the largest value such that (17) is maintained. After
that
(i) there exists an edge e of G/Ω with wπ(e) = 0 such that e
intersects even(F) but not odd(F),
or (ii) there exists a U ∈ odd(F) with |U| ≥ 3 and π(U) = 0.
First assume (i) holds. If only one end of e belongs to even(F), extend F
by e. If both ends of e belong to even(F) and F ∪ {e} contains a circuitC,
let U := V C and CU := C, add U to Ω (defining π(U) := 0), and replace F
by F/U and M by M/U. If both ends of e belong to even(F) and F ∪ {e}
contains an M-augmenting path, augment M and reset F := M.
Next assume (ii) holds. Delete U from Ω, replace F by F ∪ P ∪ N and
M by M ∪ N, where P is the even-length path in CU connecting the two
edges of F incident with U and where N is the matching in CU covering all
vertices in U that are not covered by M.
(Note that in this iteration α is bounded, since P
U∈Ω
π(U) is bounded (by (18), as
there is at least one perfect matching), and since |even(F)| > |odd(F)| (as M is not
perfect).)
If M is a perfect matching in G/Ω, we are done: by (20) we can expand M to a
perfect matching N in G with wπ(N) = 0 and |N ∩δ(U)| = 1 for each U ∈ Ω; then N
has equality throughout in (18), and hence it is a minimum-weight perfect matching.
Theorem 5.5. There are at most |V |
2
iterations.
Proof. In any iteration where we augment M, the value of |V (G/Ω)|−2|M| decreases
by 2. If there is no matching augmentation, this value remains invariant. So there
are at most 1
2
|V | matching augmentations.
Let Veven be the set of vertices v ∈ V that are shrunk to a vertex in even(F).
Let Ω0 be the set of vertices of G/Ω that do not belong to even(F). Then in any
iteration with no matching augmentation, 2|Veven| + |Ω0| increases. Since this value
cannot exceed 2|V |, between any two matching augmentations there are at most 2|V |
88 Chapter 5. Nonbipartite matching
iterations.
This gives the theorem of Edmonds [1965a]:
Corollary 5.5a. A minimum-weight perfect matching can be found in polynomial
time.
Proof. The nestedness of Ω implies that |Ω| ≤ 2|V | (which is an easy exercise — see
Exercise 5.10). Hence each iteration can be performed in polynomial time. With any
U ∈ Ω with |U| ≥ 3 we should keep the Hamiltonian circuit CU of (20) — which we
had obtained earlier when shrinking U.
As a consequence one can derive:
Corollary 5.5b. In any graph with weight function on the edges, a maximum-weight
matching can be found in polynomial time.
Proof. Left to the reader. (Exercise 5.9.)
The above algorithm can be implemented in time O(|V |
3
), which is a result of
Gabow [1973] and Lawler [1976]. Faster algorithms were given by Galil, Micali, and
Gabow [1986] (O(|E||V | log |V |)) and Gabow [1990] (O(|V ||E| + |V |
2
log |V |)).
For more about matchings we refer to the book of Lov´asz and Plummer [1986].
Application 5.3: Optimal pairing. In several practical situations one has to find an
‘optimal pairing’, for example, when scheduling crews for airplanes. Also if one has to
assign bus seats optimally to the participants of an organized tour, or to accommodate the
participants most satisfactorily in two-bed hotel rooms, one has to solve a maximum-weight
perfect matching problem.
Application 5.4: Airline timetabling. A European airline company has for its European
flights a number of airplanes available. Each plane can make on any day two return flights to
European destinations (not necessarily the same destinations). The profit one makes on any
flight depends on the departure and arrival times of the flight (also due to intercontinental
connections). The company wants to make a timetable so that it can be performed by
the available fleet and so that the total profit is maximized. Assume that the number of
destinations to be reached is equal to twice the number of airplanes available.
To solve this problem, consider the complete graph with vertex set all possible destinations. For each edge of this graph, connecting destinations B and C say, one calculates the
profit that will be made if one and the same air plane will make its flights to B and C (in
one order or the other). So one determines the optimum schedule for the flights to B and C
so that the two return flights can be done by the same airplane and so that the total profit
on the two flights is maximized.
Now a timetable yielding maximum profit is found by determining a maximum-weight

perfect matching in this graph.
Application 5.5: Chinese postman problem. The Chinese postman problem, first
studied by Guan [1960], consists of the following. Given a connected graph G = (V, E) and
a length function l : E → Q+, find a minimum-length tour T that traverses each edge at
least once.
It is not difficult to see that if each vertex of G has an even degree, then the optimal
tour traverses each edge exactly once. But if the graph has vertices of odd degree, certain
edges have to be traversed more than once. To find such edges we can proceed as follows.
First determine the set U of vertices of odd degree. Note that |U| is even. For each pair
u, u′ of vertices in U determine the distance d(u, u′
) between u and u
′
in the graph G (taking
l as length). Consider the complete graph H = (U, E′
) on U. Determine a minimum-weight
perfect matching M in H, taking d as weight function. For each edge uu′
in M we can
determine a path Pu,u′ in G of length d(u, u′
). It can be shown that any two different such
paths do not have any edge in common (assuming that each edge has positive length) —
see Exercise 5.13. Let E˜ be the set of edges occurring in the Pu,u′ (uu′ ∈ M). Then there
exists a tour T so that each edge e ∈ E \ E˜ is traversed exactly once and each edge e ∈ E˜ is
traversed exactly twice. This tour T is a shortest ‘Chinese postman tour’ (Exercise 5.14).
Application 5.6: Christofides’ approximative algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. Christofides [1976] designed the following algorithm to find a short traveling salesman tour in a graph (generally not the shortest however). The traveling salesman
problem is the problem, given a finite set V and a ‘length’ function l : V × V → Q+, to find
a shortest traveling salesman tour. A traveling salesman tour (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a
circuit in the complete graph on V traversing each vertex exactly once.
Suppose that the length function is symmetric (that is, l(u, v) = l(v, u) for all u, v ∈ V )
and satisfies the triangle inequality:
(22) l(u, w) ≤ l(u, v) + l(v, w)
for all u, v, w ∈ V . Then a reasonably short traveling salesman tour can be found as follows.
First determine a shortest spanning tree S (with the greedy algorithm). Next, let U be
the set of vertices that have odd degree in S. Find a shortest perfect matching M on U,
taking l as weight function. Now ES ∪ M forms a set of edges such that each vertex has
even degree. (If an edge occurs both in ES and in M, we take it as two parallel edges.) So
we can make a cycle T such that each edge in ES ∪ M is traversed exactly once. Then T
traverses each vertex at least once. By inserting shortcuts we obtain a traveling salesman
tour T
′ with length(T
′
) ≤length(T).
How far away is the length of T
′
from the length of a shortest traveling salesman tour?
Let ρ be the length of a shortest traveling salesman tour. It is not difficult to show that:
(23) (i) length(S) ≤ ρ;
(ii) length(M) ≤
1
2
ρ.
(Exercise 5.18.) Hence
90 Chapter 5. Nonbipartite matching
(24) length(T
′
) ≤length(T) =length(S)+length(M) ≤
3
2
ρ.
So the tour obtained with Christofides’ algorithm is not longer than 3
2
times the optimal
tour.
The factor 3
2
seems quite large, but it is the smallest factor for which a polynomial-time
method is known. Don’t forget moreover that it is a worst-case bound, and that in practice
(or on average) the algorithm might have a much better performance.

5.4. The matching polytope
The weighted matching algorithm of Edmonds [1965a] gives as a side result a characterization of the perfect matching polytope Pperfect matching(G) of any graph G. This
is Edmonds’ matching polytope theorem.
The perfect matching polytope of a graph G = (V, E), denoted by Pperfect matching(G),
is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the perfect matchings in G.
18 That is,
18For any finite set X and any subset Y of X, the incidence vector or incidence function of a
subset Y of X is the vector χ
Y ∈ R
X defined by: χ
Y
x
:= 1 if x ∈ Y and χ

x
:= 0 otherwise.
92 Chapter 5. Nonbipartite matching
Figure 5.3. Part of the Xuhui district of Shanghai
(26) Pperfect matching(G) =conv.hull{χ
M | M perfect matching in G}.
So Pperfect matching(G) is a polytope in R
E.
In Section 3.6 we saw that for a bipartite graph G = (V, E), the perfect matching
polytope is fully determined by the following set of inequalities:
(27) (i) xe ≥ 0 for each e ∈ E;
(ii) P
e∋v
xe = 1 for each v ∈ V .
These inequalities are not enough for, say, K3: taking x(e) := 1
2
for each edge e of K3
gives a vector x satisfying (27) but not belonging to the perfect matching polytope
of K3.
Edmonds [1965a] showed that it is enough to add the following set of inequalities:
(28) X
e∈δ(U)
xe ≥ 1 for each odd subset U of V .
It is clear that for any perfect matching M in G the incidence vector χ
M satisfies
(28). So clearly, Pperfect matching(G) is contained in the polyhedron Q defined by (27)
and (28). The essence of Edmonds’ theorem is that one does not need more.
In order to show Edmonds’ theorem, we derive from Edmonds’ algorithm the
following theorem, where Podd(V ) denotes the collection of odd subsets of V :
Theorem 5.6. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and let w : E → Q be a ‘weight’ function.
Then the minimum weight of a perfect matching is equal to the m
P
aximum value of
X∈Podd(V )
π(X) where π ranges over all functions π : Podd(V ) → Q satisfying (17).
Section 5.4. The matching polytope 93
Proof. We may assume that w is nonnegative: if µ is the minimum value of w(e) over
all edges e, decreasing each w(e) by µ decreases both the maximum and the minimum
by 1
2
|V |µ.
The fact that the minimum is not smaller than the maximum follows from (18).
Equality follows from the fact that in the algorithm the final perfect matching and
the final function π have equality throughout in (18).
This implies:
Corollary 5.6a (Edmonds’ perfect matching polytope theorem). The perfect matching polytope of any graph G = (V, E) is determined by (27) and (28).
Proof. By Theorem 5.6 and LP-duality, for any weight function w ∈ QE, the minimum weight of a perfect matching is equal to the minimum of w
T x taken over the
polytope determined by (27) and (28). Hence the two polytopes coincide, by Theorem
2.1.
From this one can derive Edmonds’ matching polytope theorem, characterizing
the matching polytope of a graph G = (V, E), denoted by Pmatching(G), which is the
convex hull of the incidence vectors of the matchings in G. That is,
(29) Pmatching(G) =conv.hull{χ
M | M matching in G}.
Again, Pmatching(G) is a polytope in R
E.
Corollary 5.6b (Edmonds’ matching polytope theorem). For any graph G = (V, E)
the matching polytope is determined by:
(30) (i) xe ≥ 0 for each e ∈ E;
(ii) P
e∋v
xe ≤ 1 for each v ∈ V ;
(iii) P
e⊂U
xe ≤ ⌊ 1
2
|U|⌋ for each U ⊆ V with |U| odd.
Proof. Left to the reader (Exercise 5.21).
This in turn has the following consequence:
Corollary 5.6c. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and let w : E → Q+. Then the maximum
weight of a matching is equal to the minimum value of

In fact, Cunningham and Marsh’ theorem shows that if w is integer-valued, we
can restrict y and z to integer vectors — see Section 5.5.
